## User Journey:
The user opens the game page where he has to enter his name to start playing. Once he enters, he is going to answer questions on JavaScript. At the end, he can check his score in the scoreboard in the homepage.

## User Stories:

- As a User, I want to be able to open the app page and see a brief description of the game and how to play.
- As a User, I should be able to check the leaderboard that contains the high score with the name of the players.
- As a User, I should have a button to start the game. The game should ask the player to enter his/her name. The game should give 10 random MC questions to the user with 4 options to each question(only one right answer).
- As a User, I want to have a button to move to the next question after answering the current question. The next question button should only appear/activate after answering the question.
- As a User, I should be able to see how many questions I still have to answer(2/10 meaning that I am on the second question).
- As a User, I should be able to see my score after finishing all of the questions.
